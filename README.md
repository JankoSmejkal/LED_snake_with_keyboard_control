# LED snake with keyboard control
Simple Raspberry Pi LED snake with keyboard control implemented using Python. 

3 LEDs snake moving right, left, both ways and flashing. Direction is controlled using keyboard keys 'l' for left,
'r' for right, 'b' for both ways and 'j' for flashing.

# Keyboard control
is implemented using curses library, so the script must be run through terminal.
